                    <li>The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. It was constructed between 1887 and 1889 to be the entranceway to the 1889 World’s Fair and to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The tower was opened to visitors on May 6, 1889.</li>
                    <li>Gustave Eiffel’s design was chosen unanimously from among 700 that were submitted to the World’s Fair design competition. However, many Parisians, especially artists, did not like the design and protested the tower’s construction. They thought it would be an eyesore, but once it was built, most Parisians soon loved the tower.</li>
                    <li>The tower is made of iron and weighs over 7,000 tons. It features open latticework supports, an unusual design at the time. Many of the scientific principles used in its design and construction are still used to construct modern skyscrapers. Over 40 tons of paint are applied to the tower every seven years to keep it from rusting.</li>
                    <li>The Eiffel Tower is over 1,000 feet tall (about 305 meters). At the time of its construction, it was the tallest structure in the world, with a staircase with 1,665 steps. There are also elevators to take visitors to the top platform where there is a panoramic view of Paris. Those original elevators, now computerized, are still in use.</li>
                    <li>Originally, the Eiffel Tower was to remain in place for just 20 years, and there were plans to begin demolishing it in 1909. Telegraph antennas were saved it from being taken down, and it has become symbolic of Paris.</li>
                    <li>The Eiffel Tower has also become a symbol of Paris. It is the most visited paid monument in the world and is considered an architectural masterpiece. Over 200 million people have visited it since May 6, 1889.</li>
