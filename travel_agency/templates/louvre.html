                    <li>The Louvre Museum is located in Paris, France. It is the largest and one of the most famous art museums in the world, attracting millions of visitors annually.</li>
                    <li>The museum was originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century under Philip II. It was later converted into a royal palace in the 16th century before becoming a public museum during the French Revolution in 1793.</li>
                    <li>The Louvre is home to an impressive collection of over 380,000 pieces of art, including paintings, sculptures, and archaeological artifacts, although only about 35,000 are displayed at any given time.</li>
                    <li>The most iconic artwork at the Louvre is Leonardo da Vinci’s **Mona Lisa**, which draws millions of visitors annually. Other masterpieces include the **Venus de Milo**, **Winged Victory of Samothrace**, and Eugène Delacroix’s **Liberty Leading the People**.</li>
                    <li>In 1989, the museum underwent a major renovation with the addition of the **glass pyramid entrance**, designed by architect I. M. Pei. The pyramid has become a modern symbol of the Louvre and a key part of its identity.</li>
                    <li>The Louvre Museum spans over 72,735 square meters of exhibition space. It is considered a must-visit destination for art and history enthusiasts, offering an unparalleled glimpse into human creativity and culture.</li>
